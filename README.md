A personal portfolio website constructed using react, vite and pure css. Hope you enjoy what you see and let me know of any changes I should make.

Planned features:
- Small games that I personally enjoy. E.g. Snake?
- Pop up windows (similar to mini browsers) for portfolio page and about me page.
- More options to change theme in the future?
